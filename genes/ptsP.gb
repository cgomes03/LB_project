            REFSEQ INFORMATION: The reference sequence is identical to
            DS483503.1.
            Faecalibacterium prausnitzii M21/2 (GenBank Accession Number for
            16S rDNA gene: AY305307) is a member of the division Firmicutes. In
            one comprehensive 16S rDNA sequence-based enumeration of the
            colonic microbiota of three healthy adult humans, it represents, on
            average, 3.804% of all 16S rDNA sequences and 7.490% of the
            sequences in its division (Eckburg et. al. (2005)). The sequenced
            strain was obtained from the laboratory of Prof. Harry Flint,
            Rowett Research Institute, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK
            (H.Flint@rowett.ac.uk).
            We have collected 8.4X coverage in plasmid end reads and 454 reads.
            We will be performing one round of automated sequence improvement
            (pre-finishing).
            Sequencing/Assembly: The genomic DNA was purified from liquid
            culture derived from a single bacterial colony. A hybrid sequencing
            strategy that utilized reads from both 454 GS-20 and ABI 3730xl
            sequencers was devised and implemented to generate the draft genome
            sequences. 454 reads were assembled using Newbler (454 Life
            Sciences) into 454 de novo contigs. These de novo contigs were
            converted in silico to 800 base paired reads ('superreads') with
            400 base overlaps with neighboring superreads.  Finally, PCAP
            (Huang, et al, Genome Research, 13:2164, (2003)) was used to
            assemble the super-reads and the conventional 3730xl capillary
            reads.
            This sequenced strain is part of a comprehensive, sequence-based
            survey of members of the normal human gut microbiota.  A joint
            effort of the WU-GSC and the Center for Genome Sciences at
            Washington University School of Medicine, the purpose of this
            survey is to provide the general scientific community with a broad
            view of the gene content of 100 representatives of the major
            divisions represented in the intestine's microbial community. This
            information should provide a frame of reference for analyzing
            metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Further details of
            this effort are described in a white paper entitled 'ExtendingOur
            View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)'
            (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/HGMIS

            Research Institute.

            Research Institute.
            Coding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2
            v2.13. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were
            blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions
            generated based on protein alignments. RNA genes were determined
            using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 or Rfam v8.0. Gene names are generated at
            the contig level and may not necessarily reflect any known order or
            orientation between contigs.These studies are supported by National
            Human Genome Research Institute.

            Annotation was added to the contigs in October 2007, and the CDS
            comments were updated in January 2008.
            This is a reference genome for the Human Microbiome Project. This
            project is co-owned with the Human Microbiome Project DACC.
            Product names were updated in August 2012.
            The annotation was added by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation
            Pipeline (PGAP). Information about PGAP can be found here:
