# Bioinformatics Lab Project 2024/2025

## Overview

This project focuses on the bioinformatic analysis of genes from microorganisms in the human gut microbiome. The goal is to analyze gene sequences, study their structure, and interpret their potential functions, interactions, and relationships to health and disease.

## Project Objectives

- Select and analyze genes from microorganisms in the human microbiome.
- Use bioinformatics tools to study gene sequences (DNA, RNA, proteins).
- Investigate homologous sequences and related data from literature and databases.
- Interpret results to infer gene functions and interactions.

## Workflow

1. **Gene Selection**: This group selected *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* as the microorganism in study and a gene per group member.
   - *Genes*:
     - FAEPRAM212_RS11550
     - ptsP
     - FAEPRAM212_03428
2. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - Retrieve gene sequences from NCBI and other databases.
   - Perform homology searches (BLAST) and functional annotations.
   - Analyze protein properties using UniProt, PDB, and conserved domain databases.
3. **Multiple Sequence Alignment and Phylogeny**:
   - Perform alignments and build phylogenetic trees to identify conserved regions.
4. **Regulation and Variant Analysis**:
   - Investigate regulatory interactions and gene variants.

## Team Contributions

Each group member is responsible for analyzing one gene. The portfolio includes a credits section detailing individual contributions. This code was developed by Catarina and Maria. The branch protein_analysis was developed by Muneeb.
